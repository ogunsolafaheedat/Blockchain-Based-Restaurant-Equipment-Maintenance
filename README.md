# Blockchain-Based Restaurant Equipment Maintenance

This repository contains a decentralized solution for managing restaurant equipment maintenance using blockchain technology. The system provides transparency, accountability, and streamlined management of kitchen equipment servicing.

## System Overview

The platform consists of four core smart contracts:

1. **Equipment Registration Contract**: Digitally catalogs all kitchen equipment with detailed specifications
2. **Service Scheduling Contract**: Automates preventive maintenance scheduling based on manufacturer recommendations
3. **Technician Verification Contract**: Validates and maintains a registry of qualified service technicians
4. **Compliance Tracking Contract**: Ensures all maintenance meets health department regulations

## Key Features

- Immutable equipment service history for each asset
- Automated maintenance reminders and scheduling
- Verified technician marketplace with reputation system
- Digital compliance documentation for health inspections
- Real-time equipment status monitoring
- Secure payment processing for maintenance services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
